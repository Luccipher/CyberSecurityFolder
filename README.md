Risk Description
The risk assessment conducted for Botium Toys has identified several key issues. The current management of assets is inadequate, which poses a significant risk to the organization. Furthermore, Botium Toys lacks the necessary controls to ensure compliance with both U.S. and international regulations and standards, further increasing the risk exposure.

Control Best Practices
To mitigate the identified risks, Botium Toys should implement the following control best practices:

Identify Assets: Botium Toys needs to dedicate resources to effectively manage and identify all assets within the organization. This includes maintaining an up-to-date inventory of hardware, software, and other critical assets.

Business Impact Analysis: It is crucial for Botium Toys to conduct a business impact analysis to determine the potential consequences of asset loss. This analysis should assess the impact on business continuity and prioritize asset protection accordingly.

Compliance and Regulatory Adherence: Botium Toys must ensure compliance with relevant U.S. and international regulations and standards. This includes data privacy regulations, industry-specific guidelines, and any other applicable legal requirements.

Access Control and Vendor Management: Implement robust access control mechanisms to limit unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data. Additionally, establish a comprehensive vendor management process to ensure that third-party access is properly monitored and controlled.

Risk Management Framework: Adopt a risk management framework, such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), to establish a systematic approach to identifying, assessing, and mitigating cybersecurity risks. This will provide a structured methodology for managing assets and maintaining a secure environment.

Risk Score
The risk associated with the current state of assets and controls at Botium Toys has been assessed with a score of 8 on a scale of 1 to 10. This score indicates a fairly high risk level, necessitating immediate attention and appropriate measures to mitigate the identified risks.

Additional Comments
The potential impact from the loss of an asset is rated as medium since the IT department lacks knowledge about which assets might be lost. However, the likelihood of asset loss or fines from governing bodies is high due to the absence of adequate controls and non-compliance with necessary regulations and standards, particularly concerning customer data privacy.

It is crucial for Botium Toys to address these risks promptly to safeguard the organization's assets, protect sensitive information, maintain regulatory compliance, and ensure the continuity of business operations.

By implementing the recommended control best practices and adopting a risk management framework, Botium Toys can significantly enhance its cybersecurity posture and mitigate the identified risks effectively. Regular monitoring, review, and updates should be conducted to ensure ongoing compliance and resilience in the face of emerging threats and changing regulatory requirements.
